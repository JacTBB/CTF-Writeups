## Solution

1. Continuing from the pastebin with the flag for World Wide Wandere 3, the description reads:
```
Final adventure:
Country flags are cool.
Hint 1: Flags are so important, they even made a code using them!
Hint 2: I love picking out the primary/main colors of the flags and joining them to make a new flag.
Flag code: 21B12
 
Visit the country after you have identified the flag. See what you can find there!
```
2. Search online for the International Code Of Signals Maritime Flags.
3. Decode 21B12 and you get Blue, White, Red, White, Blue.
4. Google those colours and you will find the Costa Rica Flag.
5. Go to Costa Rica on the map and zoom in, you will see a spot with many pointers.
6. Zoom in and you will find the flag made up of pointers spelling YOU_C4N_F1ND.
7. Wrap it in the flag and submit.
```
Flag: NYP{YOU_C4N_F1ND}
```
